- You may close the application and then reload, to continue filling the form from where you left it (You will only be able to save data when you've filled all the necessary fields of the respective tab).
- After you've filled all relevant fields and uploaded your CV and LOR (PDF format), proceed to the third tab.
- Click on the 'Final Save' button.If the text 'Final Save' turns green (hard to notice,please look carefully),your data has been successfully created in the package folder (in the UserData folder[created by the app]).
- Exit the application and browse to the project folder to find your data (in .txt format and .dat format) in the UerdData/your_roll_number folder
- Enrollment number for the current applicant is generated and displayed on the Console.
- Ignore any other text displayed on Console (purely for debugging purposes :p ).

Copy this folder to the admin package after you're done with filling forms.
