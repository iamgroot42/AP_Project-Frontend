AP Project Frontend (Anshuman & Satyam)
- Frontend : Anshuman
- Backend : Satyam

How to Use the Applciation :
- Run the applciation via Eclipse (4.5 ot higher).
- You may face 'build configuration problem' when trying to launch the application. Add external .JARs to Build Path to fix this error.
- Fill all the necessary fields in any of the tabs and click on the 'save' button on the bottom of the respective tab to save your work.
- You may close the application and then reload, to continue filling the form from where you left it (You will only be able to save data when you've filled all the necessary fields of the respective tab).
- After you've filled all relevant fields and uploaded your CV and LOR (PDF format), proceed to the third tab.
- Click on the 'Final Save' button.If the text 'Final Save' turns green (hard to notice,please look carefully),your data has been successfully created in the package folder (in the UserData folder[created by the app]).
- Exit the application and browse to the project folder to find your data (in .txt format and .dat format) in the UerdData/ypur_roll_number folder
- Ignore any text displayed on Console (purely for debugging purposes :p ).

Copy this folder to the admin package after you're done with filling forms.
